def parse(tokens):
    """Parses a list of tokens into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
    This function takes a list of tokens, each represented as a tuple containing
    the line number and the command with its arguments. It converts these tokens
    into a structured format that can be used for further processing, such as
    code generation or analysis.
    The AST is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a line
    of code with its corresponding command and arguments. Each dictionary
    contains the following keys:
    - "line": The line number of the code.
    - "command": The command (e.g., PRINT, GOTO) in uppercase.
    - "args": A list of arguments associated with the command.
    This structured representation allows for easier manipulation and analysis
    of the code, making it suitable for tasks such as code generation or
    optimization.
    The function iterates through the list of tokens, extracting the line number,
    command, and arguments for each token. It then constructs a dictionary for
    each line of code and appends it to the AST list. The final result is a
    comprehensive representation of the entire code, ready for further processing.
    The function is designed to be flexible and can handle various commands and
    arguments, making it a versatile tool for parsing BASIC code.

    Args:
        tokens (_type_): _description_

    Returns:
        _type_: _description_
